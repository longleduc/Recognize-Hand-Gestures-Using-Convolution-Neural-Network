# Recognize-Hand-Gestures-Using-Convolution-Neural-Network
This is a programm to detect which kind of hand gesture you are perform using Convolution Neural Network.

#HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAMM
1. Run makeDataset.py to make your own Dataset for training
2. Run ResizeImages.py to resize all of your images to 89 x 100 dimension images so it can be suitable for Convolution 
Neural Network
3. Run TrainModel.py to retrain the model using your custom Dataset
4. Run predictGestures.py to predict which kind of gestures you are perform in realtime
